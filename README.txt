** We are turning in two versions of the project because the version in the           **
** master branch uses hashmaps and has a java GUI while the version in the            **
** Revised_Project_1 branch (the current branch) is the more basic and rudimentary    **
** version of the project that  follows the rubric and other guidelines given to us   **
